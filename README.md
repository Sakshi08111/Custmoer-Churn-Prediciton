Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains customer details and their subscription status.


📊 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as customer demographics, service subscriptions, contract type, tenure, monthly charges, and total charges.
The target variable is Churn, which indicates whether a customer has left the service (Yes/No).
